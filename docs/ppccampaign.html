		                        <p>The Objective of the campaign was to increase visibility of the professionals private profiles featured in the organization’s website and increase customers’ contacts through the website. The challenge was to create ad groups and ads that would be relevant to users searching for HCPs in the locations where they operated, and try to avoid ads from showing to users searching from other locations in Ireland. At the same time we needed to find a quick way to set up a single, manageable campaign to meet budget and time requirements.&nbsp;<br></p>

		                        <p>We initially reviewed the page were users could see the list of locations with these professionals in Ireland, to improve its performance in Google organic and Paid results. 
		<br>We also reviewed location-specific landing pages. These pages featured groups of orthodontists working in specific areas or counties in Ireland. We added a Google map to each page and keyword reach copy to make them easier to use and perform better organically. These pages were used as landing pages for those AdWords group containing location related keywords e.g. “find a [professional category] in Galway”
		<br>We also reviewed and optimized other pages on the website. These were used for ad groups that did not contain location keywords, but contained keywords related to generic information about treatments, membership information and more. 
		<br>Google AdWords Editor was used to quickly set up the campaign, by creating one set of location specific ads and replacing the location names in the ads copy for every location ad group. 
		<br>We set up a bid adjustment of +20% for mobile and for the major cities in Ireland. Sitelink and callout extensions were also added to the campaign to increase CTRs.  
		<br>We set up conversion tracking, where a Goal was defined as a visit to a specific professional’s profile page. This way, we were able to find out which keywords were driving the most traffic to their profiles. 
		<br>Keywords were initially set up with the keyword match modifier. They were optimized on an ongoing bases by adjusting bids, pausing keywords, changing match types and so on. 
		<br>Further optimization included setting up event tracking in Google Analytics in order to track clicks to contact details such as phone number or email address. Clicks to phone numbers or emails were considered possible leads. Google Analytics events were used as new, more accurate conversions goals in Google AdWords. 
		<br>Finally, all ads were replaced with the new extended ad rolled out by Google in 2016, to increase ads’ performance. &nbsp;<br></p>

		                        <p>Even with a relatively small monthly budget, since its beginning this campaign has maintained an excellent performance. The campaign continues to generate valuable traffic and qualified leads to the website. This is mainly due to the specificity of the ad groups, very specific keywords groups and their landing pages. The overall avg. CTR has never gone below 2.33%, with peaks of 8% for certain ad groups and CTR of 25% and over for certain keywords (showing a relevant number of clicks). The average CPC oscillated between 0.2 and 0.3 cents. Keywords Quality Score was maintained between 6 and 10. Traffic from Google ads have an average of 2 pages visited per session. Conversion rates, as defined above, averaged between 30% and 40%.
		<br>Since text ads were replaced to extended ads, the CTR has increased by 30%. &nbsp;<br><br></p>
